# Haskell

Haskell is a **general-purpose**, **statically typed**, **purely functional** programming language with **type inference** (refers to the automatic detection of the type of an expression) and **lazy evaluation** (is an evaluation strategy which delays the evaluation of an expression until its value is needed, which avoids repeated evaluations).
